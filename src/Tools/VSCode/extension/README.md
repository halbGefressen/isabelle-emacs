# Isabelle Prover IDE support

This extension connects VSCode to the Isabelle Prover IDE infrastructure: it
requires a suitable repository version of Isabelle.

The implementation is centered around the VSCode Language Server protocol, but
with many add-ons that are specific to VSCode and Isabelle/PIDE.

## Notable Features

  * Static syntax tables for Isabelle `.thy` and `.ML` files.

  * Implicit dependency management of sources, subject to changes of theory
  files within the editor, as well as external file-system events.

  * Implicit formal checking of theory files, using the *cursor position* of the
  active editor panel as indication for relevant spots.

  * Text overview lane with formal status of prover commands (unprocessed,
  running, error, warning).

  * Prover messages within the source text (errors/warnings and information
  messages).

  * Semantic text decorations: colors for free/bound variables, inferred types
  etc.

  * Visual indication of formal scopes and hyperlinks for formal entities.

  * Implicit proof state output via the VSCode message channel "Isabelle
  Output".

  * Explicit proof state output via separate GUI panel (command
  `isabelle.state`).

  * HTML preview via separate GUI panel (command `isabelle.preview`).

  * Rich completion information: Isabelle symbols (e.g. `\forall` or
  `\<forall>`), outer syntax keywords, formal entities, file-system paths,
  BibTeX entries etc.

  * Spell-checking of informal texts, including dictionary operations: via the
  regular completion dialog.


## Requirements

### Isabelle/VSCode Installation

  * Download a recent Isabelle development snapshot from
    <https://isabelle.sketis.net/devel/release_snapshot>

  * Unpack and run the main Isabelle/jEdit application as usual, to ensure that
  the logic image is built properly and Isabelle works as expected.

  * Download and install VSCode from <https://code.visualstudio.com>

  * Open the VSCode *Extensions* view and install the following:

      + *Isabelle* (needs to fit to the underlying Isabelle release).

      + *bibtexLanguage* (optional): it gives `.bib` a formal status, thus
        `@{cite}` antiquotations become active for completion and hyperlinks.

  * Restart the VSCode application to ensure that all extensions are properly
  initialized and user settings are updated. Afterwards VSCode should know about
  `.thy` files (Isabelle theories) and `.ML` files (Isabelle/ML modules).

  The Isabelle extension is initialized when the first Isabelle file is opened.
  It requires a few seconds to start up: a small popup window eventually says
  *"Welcome to Isabelle ..."*.


### Further Preferences

  * Preferred Color Theme: `Light+ (default light)`

  * Alternative Color Theme: `Dark+ (default dark)` â€“ with restrictions: some
  color combinations don't work out properly.

  * Recommended changes to default VSCode settings:

    ```
    "editor.acceptSuggestionOnEnter": "off",
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": true,
    ```

## Known Limitations of Isabelle/VSCode

  * Isabelle symbol abbreviations like "-->" are not accepted by VSCode.

  * Lack of formal editor perspective in VSCode: only the cursor position is
  used (with some surrounding lines of text).

  * Lack of formal markup in prover messages and popups.

  * Lack of pretty-printing (logical line breaks) according to window and font
  dimensions.

  * Lack of GUI panels for Sledgehammer, Query operations etc.

  * Big theory files may cause problems to the VSCode rendering engine, since
  messages and text decorations are applied to the text as a whole (cf. the
  minimap view).
